What Is the Pomodoro Technique? The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they have—rather than against it.
Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks.
These intervals are referred to as pomodoros. <br>
with this you can count time between intervals, this program is made with Tkinter (standard GUI library for Python) <br>
it has start button, witch starts the countdown<br>
reset button, witch resetes everything<br>
after each work time under the tomato will appear green check mark "✓" up to 4.<br>
after countdown reaches 00:00, break time (5 min) will replace work time and vice versa.
